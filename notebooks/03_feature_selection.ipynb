    "**Objective:** In this notebook, we will use various techniques to select the most important features from our original processed dataset (`heart_disease_processed.csv`). Unlike PCA, which transforms features, feature selection *chooses* a subset of the original features. This can improve model performance by eliminating irrelevant data and results in a more interpretable model.\n",

    "**Method:** We will start with a powerful technique called **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**. RFE works by recursively removing the least important features and building a model on the remaining features until the desired number of features is reached."
